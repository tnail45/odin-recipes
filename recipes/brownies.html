        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>
            Brownies are decadent, chocolatey treats known for their rich texture and fudgy or cake-like consistency.
            They are typically baked in a square or rectangular pan and cut into individual portions. Brownies often include ingredients 
            like chocolate, butter, sugar, eggs, and flour, with variations such as adding nuts or swirls of caramel or cream cheese. 
            After baking, they are enjoyed warm or at room temperature, sometimes accompanied by a scoop of ice cream
            or a dusting of powdered sugar for extra sweetness.
